# Sexbook To-Do List

### Improvements

* More documentations
* Preferred colours for `CrushesStat`
* Preferred colours for crushes?
* Remove statTitle's background?
* Make `Taste`'s spinner have transparent background and yellow text in night mode
* Progressive charts for `QuantitativeTasteFragment`
* Yearly time series
* Enlarge `json_export.xml` and `json_import.xml`
* A ProgressBar for `Place`-`Report` migrations and statistics
* Random `Crush` suggestion in `PageLove`
* Put a menu button in the overflow portion of `ReportAdap`
* What to do with the splash screen on Android 12+? (the icon over there has become invisible!)
* DotsIndicator for `Taste` and `CrushesStat` (with caution)
* "Reactivate Crush" for `Singular`
* Fictionality, first met / first orgasm year for `Taste` and `CrushesStat`

### Bad Ideas

* Search for People through their names, locations and IG accounts
* Search for Reports in their names and descriptions
