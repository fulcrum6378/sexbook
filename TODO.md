# Sexbook To-Do List

### Improvements

* A better icon for birthday notifications
* A ProgressBar for `Place`-`Report` migrations and statistics
* Random `Crush` suggestion in `PageLove`
* Put a menu button in the overflow portion of `ReportAdap`
* What to do with the splash screen on Android 12+? (the icon over there has become invisible!)
* DotsIndicator for `Taste` and `CrushesStat`
* Progressive diagrams for `Taste`
* "Reactivate Crush" for `Singular`
* Fictionality, first met / first orgasm year for `Taste` and `CrushesStat`

### Bad Ideas

* Search for People through their names, locations and IG accounts
* Search for Reports in their names and descriptions
