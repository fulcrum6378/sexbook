# Sexbook To-Do List

### Improvements

* Elevation shadows for the tops of `SummaryDialog` and `RecencyDialog`' lists and the bottom of the former
* List pairs of a `Crush` with whom they have ever shared orgasms
* Maintain the position of `CrushesStat`
* Line chart for `Place`s?
* Documentations for HelloCharts
* Preferred colours for crushes?
* Remove statTitle's background?
* Make `Taste`'s spinner have transparent background and yellow text in night mode
* Yearly time series
* Enlarge `json_export.xml` and `json_import.xml`
* A ProgressBar for `Place`-`Report` migrations and statistics
* Random `Crush` suggestion in `PageLove`
* Put a menu button in the overflow portion of `ReportAdap`
* What to do with the splash screen on Android 12+? (the icon over there has become invisible!)
* DotsIndicator for `Taste` and `CrushesStat` (with caution)

### Bad Ideas

* Search for People through their names, locations and IG accounts
* Search for Reports in their names and descriptions
